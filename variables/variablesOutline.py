#1)
#Make an example variable of each of the types of variables (int, float, 
#string, boolean and list):
var1 = 1
var2 = 1.5
var3 = "helloWorld"
listVar2 = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
#2)
#Make two variables one named 'a' and one named 'A' both set to  different data:
#(Remember that capitalization matters, so these can be two different variables)
var5 = 'a'
var6 = 'A'

#3)
#Make a variable, and then go down a couple lines and change the data in that
#same variable:
var7 = 1


var7 = 3

#4)
#Make a variable and set it to a variable you have already created:
var2 = 1.5

#5)
#Make a list with three items. Make a variable that is set to the second
#item in that list:
listInt = [1, 2, 3]
a = 2

#6)
#Make a String set to your name. Make a variable that is set to the first item
#in that list:
string = "laura"

var9 = (laura)
#7)
#Print out ONE of any of the variables you have created so far:

print(var1)


#8)
#Make a variable of any type, with one of the common SYNTAX errors

var15 = 'helloWorld'
