#1) Make two string variables. Compare them using the == operator and store
#that comparison in a new variable. Then print the variable.
x = "laura" == "laura"
print(x)

#2) Make two int variables. Compare them using the == operator and store
#that comparison in a new variable. Then print the variable.
y = 2 == 2
print(y)

#3) Make two int variables. Compare them using the > operator and store
#that comparison in a new variable. Then print the variable.
z = 6 > 4
print(z)

#4) Make two int variables. Compare them using the < operator and store
#that comparison in a new variable. Then print the variable.
l = 2 < 8
print(l)

#5) Make two int variables. Compare them using the >= operator and store
#that comparison in a new variable. Then print the variable.
m = 6 >= 6
print(m)

#6) Make two int variables. Compare them using the <= operator and store
#that comparison in a new variable. Then print the variable.
n = 5 <= 6
print(n)

#7) Make a comparison with any operator, with one of the common SYNTAX errors.
d = 4 === 4
print(d)
