#1) Make two string variables and use the + operator to combine them into
#one new variable.
x = "laura" + "gacharna"
print(x)

#2) Make two int variables and use the + operator to combine them into
#one new variable.
y = 8 + 8
print(y)

#3) Make two int variables and use the - operator to combine them into
#one new variable.
z = 11 - 6
print(z)


#4) Make two float variables  and use the - operator to combine them into
#one new variable.
a = 3.5 - 1.5
print(a)

#5) Make two int variables and use the * operator to combine them into
#one new variable.
b = 4 * 4
print(b)

#6) Make one string variable and one int variable and use the * operator 
#to combine them into one new variable.
c = "yes" * 7
print(c)

#7) Make two int variables and use the / operator to combine them into
#one new variable.
d = 8 / 2
print(d)

#8) Make two float variables and use the / operator to combine them into
#one new variable.
e = 8.5 / 2.5 
print(e)

#9) Make two int variables and use the % operator to combine them into
#one new variable.
f = 5 % 4
print(f)

#10) Make two int variables and use the // operator to combine them into
#one new variable.
g = 3 // 3
print(g)

#11) Make two int variables and use the ** operator to combine them into
#one new variable.
h = 4 ** 4 
print(h)


#12) Make any type of operation with a common SYNTAX error
l = 5 + 5 
prit(l)
